<li><p>Stitching method:</p>
<ul>
<li><details><summary>Functionality</summary>

<p> Our Cozmo MCL was able to localize with reasonable accuracy in some environments (in cases where the Stitching works well). Locations with repetative patterns or extreme amounts of light greatly reduced accuracy of the localization. </p>
<p> Our group was able to improve upon a past group&#39;s MCL and make it give Cozmo a command to turn to home accordingly toward from its most believed location. Our group also created a histogram with clustered probablities and implemented the highest belief into the MCL to serve as the location to turn to.</p>
 </details>
</li>
<li><details><summary>Results</summary>

<p> Building off of the work of Leah Attai, Casey Rhodes, and Rachel Fuller, as well as examples provided by Mohammad Altaleb, we were able to construct a Monte Carlo Localization System that successfully localized the Anki Cozmo robot in some environments. Our system centered around a set of 30 photos taken 12 degrees apart to form a panorama. The panorama mapped the 360 degree area around the robot prior to its &quot;kidnapping.&quot; By rotating the robot an arbitrary number of degrees, we then &quot;kidnapped&quot; the robot. The robot would then take a single picture, and we performed a set of pixel-matching operations to determine which section of the panorama most likely corresponded with the robot&#39;s kidnapped heading. We would repeat this process ten times, rotating the robot slighty each time to collect varied data and increase the accuracy of our final identification. Thus having localized, we turned the robot to turn towards its initial &quot;home&quot; position, represented as the starting point of the panorama, reversing the kidnapping.</p>
<p> Our system&#39;s performance was generally dependent upon the success of two functions. Firstly, in order to create the panorama it was necessary to stitch together the 30 initial photos. Our stitching function, based on an example from OpenCV, struggled in certain environments that reduced the distinctions between certain photos. Too much or too little light, or a lack of identifiable landmarks would stymie the algorithm, and thus produce a low-confidence panorama that induced difficulties in our localization attempts. Secondly, out pixel-matching comparison algorithm would struggle from much the same issues, running into situations were a large area of the panorama (such as a white wall) appeared as candidates for localizations. This issue was likely the cause of several failed tests where the Cozmo robot localized close but not exactly to its home position, within 20 degrees or so.</p>
<p> The following table shows examples of test images taken in sequence that were and were not conducive to panorama-based localization. The top two, taken in the CS Lounge, are visually distinct with enough &quot;landmarks&quot; such as the striped couch, trash can, person, and chair to allow our algorithm to successfully localize. The bottom two, taken next to the CS Lounge printer, are too similar for the algorithm to extract any meaningful data -- localizations in this area appeared to be little more than guesses.</p>
 <table align="center"> 
       <tr>
       <td><img src="readme-assets/62.jpg"></td>
       <td><img src="readme-assets/63.jpg"></td>

       <td><img src="readme-assets/25.jpg"></td>
       <td><img src="readme-assets/26.jpg"></td>
       </tr>
    </table>

<p> This Histogram shows the results of one test of our localization system. The X-Axis is the width of the panorama corresponding to the 360 degree area in pixels, the Y-Axis the total probabilistic likelihood that the Cozmo is facing that area of the panorama. Blue lines represent the Cozmo&#39;s confidence in its location before localization, orange represents its confidence after localization. The point with the highest probability, here just after pixel 1400, was selected as the kidnapped location.</p>

<p> Theoretically, this approach works well when we tested on Google Colab. The advantage of this method is that it compares the images based on the similarity, which should be more accurate than compare pixel-by-pixel like in stitching method.</p>
<p> In MCL function for this approach, the return degree for Cozmo bot after determining current position is not yet verified.</p>

<h2 id="future-goals">Future Goals</h2>
<details><summary>Stitching method</summary>

<p>   The stitching algorithm used in this project would sometimes struggle with environments with few landmarks or excess/lack of light, thus not stitching all images together (issue from OpenCV). This would create a panorama that was not a true 360 degree view. Future groups could attempt a different stitching algorithm or attempt to build a world map in a different way. Our group recommendation is to avoid the use of a panorama (stitched from images) all together, as it proved too brittle for varied environments and was never as accurate as we had wanted. Other groups in this semester reported similar negative findings on the use of a panorama as well.</p>
<p>   Future groups could also rework our MCL to where Cozmo does not stop localizing until a certain belief probability/number of predictions for a location is reached. Our current implementation only rotates 10 times to localize before committing to the final belief probabilities.</p>
<p>   Our group&#39;s localization also relied on a program to randomly determine a kidnap location and then would automatically run MCL to localize. Future groups could have Cozmo map it&#39;s environment, then be in a state where it tries localize if it believes it is not at &quot;home.&quot;</p>
   </details>

<details><summary>NeuralNet method</summary>

<p>   We would love to hear results from those groups that want to continue our work. Here are some suggestions to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try from the most basic step: take 72 images (rotate 5 degrees/each image) and run the algorithm to check the accuracy (check both <em>estimated position</em> and <em>angle to rotate</em>).</li>
<li>Try with less images, can be 30, 20, 8 images. The less number of images, the more you have to do to justify to rotate robot back to the original position. I suggest smaller steps:<ol>
<li>Use our model to determine the closest image to the original position</li>
<li>Use sliding window on that image (and adjacent left, right images) to determine the exact position (like <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~durhbe01/cozmo/">Ben Durham&#39;s</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Try with different light levels.</li>
<li>Keep fine-tuned model to achieve better representative vector.   </details></li>
</ul>
